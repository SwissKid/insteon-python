# Super Basic Readme

My insteon api hookin stuff. 

## Curses Test
If you put the right API stuff in, you can use the curses_test to control stuff. "O" to turn stuff on, "o" to turn stuff off.

## Issues

I guess I should include the issues. Almost all of these are Insteon's fault - I have open bugs with their API/dev team about the fact these things don't work.

* Thermostat control. Nothing works related to thermostats. Sucks, I'm totally ditching mine once the ecobee3 homekit comes out - contact me if you'd like to purchase it.
* Dual-outlet control. Only talks to the top outlet. Bottom outlet is uncontrollable, and I can't recall finding a way to even query if it was active.
